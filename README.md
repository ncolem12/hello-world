# hello-world
My first Github experience. I'm going through the tutorial.
I'm Nicole. I've had quite a diverse professional experience. From glassblower, to routesetter, and now am changing my career learning data science techniques at Columbia University. I am a sponsored rock climber and have been competing and teaching for over ten years. I love cats and my own cat plays fetch.
